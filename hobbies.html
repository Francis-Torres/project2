        <img src="media/books.png" alt="books">
          <p>In highschool I aimed to read two books every month.</p>
          <p>Since starting college I have not made much time for reading but it continues to be an activity that I look forward to doing.</p>
          <p>I mostly read classics or random books that get recommended to me. TikTok has weird book recommendations but sometimes they are good.</p>
